  One Blue Tide night, he wandered further along the beach, searching for
  answers he’d never found. His gaze was drawn to a tide pool, shimmering more
  intensely than the rest. There, nestled among the rocks, was a small,
  glimmering creature — it looked like a cross between a fish and a dragonfly,
  with transparent wings and scales that shimmered like precious stones.
  
  With one last look at the shore, Ori followed the creature’s light into the
  water, letting it guide him down into the heart of the Blue Tide. He could
  feel his lungs tighten, his senses numbed by the cold depths, but he pressed
  forward, mesmerized by the creature’s glow. Just as his breath began to
  falter, he was pulled into an air pocket—a hidden cave beneath the waves, its
  walls lined with fragments of broken mirrors. In each reflection, he saw
  moments from his life, with Lena’s face among them, smiling, as if waiting for
  him all this time.
