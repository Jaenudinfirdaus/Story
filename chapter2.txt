  Ori, a reclusive fisherman, had seen countless Blue Tides. He was known to
  most villagers as a ghost on the shore, a figure whose heart belonged more to
  the sea than to people. Years of solitude had hardened him, but he felt a deep
  connection to the ocean’s mysteries, perhaps because he’d lost his wife, Lena,
  to those same waves one stormy night.
