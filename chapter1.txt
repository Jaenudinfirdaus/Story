  In the quiet coastal village of Mirr, people waited all year for a phenomenon
  known as the “Blue Tide.” Unlike ordinary tides, the Blue Tide seemed to bring

  one knew the source. Some claimed it was magic; others believed in underwater
  realms, hidden civilizations glowing with secrets just beneath the waves.
